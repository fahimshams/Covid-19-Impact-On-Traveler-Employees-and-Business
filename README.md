COVID-19 Data Analysis Repository

This repository contains Python code for analyzing COVID-19 data and related datasets using PySpark and Pandas. The analysis includes merging multiple datasets, handling missing values, performing SQL queries, and visualizing data using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Key Features:
- Integration of PySpark for distributed data processing and SQL querying
- Handling missing values and duplicates in datasets
- Merging multiple datasets based on common keys using SQL joins
- Conversion of Spark DataFrames to Pandas DataFrames for data visualization
- Visualization of COVID-19 cases over time, workplace visitors trends, stay-at-home requirements, and economic indicators using line plots and histograms
